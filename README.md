# PreedCraft

We try to find a variety of mods that can give you a nice and realistic feeling when you play the pack. But still we try to limit the numbers of mods, so that you don't have to load the mods that you most likely won't use anyway. That way your game should run more smooth. You can go for tech, magic, roleplay and exploration. We have mods that covers all these aspects.
